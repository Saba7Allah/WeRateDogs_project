# WeRateDogs_project
This project focuses primarily on the **data wrangling process**, which includes the following steps: **gathering, assessing, and cleaning**. Additionally, an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** section is included to better understand the data.

The data used in this project was gathered from multiple sources, including:
- A CSV file
- A file containing multiple JSON records
- A TSV file retrieved from the web

The dataset centers around the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account, which is popular for rating dogs (usually on a denominator of 10) and sharing their photos.
